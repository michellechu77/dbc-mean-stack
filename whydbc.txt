What I want to get out of this course:
I always want to keep developing my technical skills, but I know myself in needing structure and motivation behind that. DBC worked great for me my first pass through, so I was definitely interested to try it again for this course. I don't have any specifics checklist goals I'd like to have accomplished after the course, but more so want to leave with a stronger proficiency with the JS language and the ability to learn generally and specifically about each technology of the stack. Basically just want it this course to be a nice catalyst to continue curiousity, professional development, and learning.


Learning Plan:
My grand plan when registering was to do this course during a slow time at our company and no travels. Unfortunately, life happened and I'll be traveling for work every week - of course! So I'm a bit concerned about my time committment to the course, as I usally like to focus on one thing 100%, but general learning plan is to stay on track as best as possible, ask for help quickly, absorb the learning vs finishing challenges, use weekends as major crutches, and not to get so stressed when more life happens, because it will. It will probably also be really nice to have Adams as an in person resource, as he will not be traveling for work and way more available during the course. Yay for awesome co-workers!
